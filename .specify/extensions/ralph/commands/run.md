## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** treat the user input as launcher arguments only.

Recognized launcher arguments are:

- `--max-iterations N` or `-n N`
- `--model MODEL` or `-m MODEL`
- `--agent-cli CLI`
- `--verbose` or `-v`

Free-form requests such as "Implement US1", "do the next story", or "fix the tasks" are **not** instructions for this command to execute work directly. If free-form text is present:

1. Print a short warning that the text is ignored by `speckit.ralph.run` because Ralph selects work from `tasks.md`.
2. Continue launching the Ralph orchestrator with the resolved configuration.

This command **MUST NOT** implement tasks, edit project files, mark checkboxes, create commits, or run `/speckit.ralph.iterate` inline. Its only job is prerequisite validation, configuration resolution, and launching the orchestrator script.

## Purpose

This command is a **thin launcher** for the ralph loop orchestrator. It validates prerequisites, resolves configuration, and launches the platform-appropriate orchestrator script in a **visible terminal** for the user to monitor. Once the script is launched, this command's job is done — it exits immediately and does not wait for the script to complete.

## Outline

1. **Parse launcher arguments only** from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - `--max-iterations N` or `-n N` (default: from config or 10)
   - `--model MODEL` or `-m MODEL` (default: from config or `claude-sonnet-4.6`)
   - `--agent-cli CLI` (default: from config or `copilot`; supported: `copilot`, `codex`, `claude`)
     - For `copilot`, resolve the registered Spec Kit command/skill name from `.specify/integration.json`. Dot separator uses `--agent speckit.ralph.iterate`; dash/skills mode invokes `/speckit-ralph-iterate` in the prompt. Spec Kit integration options such as `--skills` are not passed as Copilot runtime flags.
   - `--verbose` or `-v` (default: false)
   - Ignore non-flag free-form text after printing the warning described above
   - Stop with a clear error for unknown flags or malformed flag values

2. **Validate prerequisites** (all MUST pass before proceeding):

   | Check | Method | On Failure |
   |-------|--------|------------|
   | Agent CLI installed | Resolve configured `agent_cli` (`copilot`, `codex`, or `claude`) with `which` or `Get-Command` | Print error with install instructions, STOP |
   | `tasks.md` exists | Search `specs/*/tasks.md` for current feature | Print error, suggest running `/speckit.tasks`, STOP |
   | Git repository | Run `git rev-parse --git-dir` | Print error: "Not a git repository", STOP |
   | Feature branch | Run `git branch --show-current`, verify not `main`/`master` | Print warning but continue |

3. **Detect feature context**:
   - Run the prerequisite check script:

     ```bash
     .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
     ```

     ```powershell
     .specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks
     ```

   - Parse FEATURE_DIR, feature name, and spec directory from output

4. **Load configuration**:
   - Read `.specify/extensions/ralph/ralph-config.yml` if it exists
   - Apply environment variable overrides (`SPECKIT_RALPH_MODEL`, `SPECKIT_RALPH_MAX_ITERATIONS`, `SPECKIT_RALPH_AGENT_CLI`)
   - CLI arguments from step 1 override everything

5. **Launch orchestrator script in a visible terminal**:
   - Detect platform and run the appropriate script in a **visible, non-hidden terminal** so the user can monitor progress directly
   - **Do NOT wait** for the script to finish — launch it and exit immediately
   - Do NOT perform any task implementation in the current agent session
   - Execute with resolved parameters:

     **PowerShell**:
     ```powershell
     & ".specify/extensions/ralph/scripts/powershell/ralph-loop.ps1" -FeatureName "{feature}" -TasksPath "{tasks_path}" -SpecDir "{spec_dir}" -MaxIterations {n} -Model "{model}" -AgentCli "{agent_cli}" [-DetailedOutput]
     ```

     **Bash**:
     ```bash
     bash ".specify/extensions/ralph/scripts/bash/ralph-loop.sh" --feature-name "{feature}" --tasks-path "{tasks_path}" --spec-dir "{spec_dir}" --max-iterations {n} --model "{model}" --agent-cli "{agent_cli}" [--verbose]
     ```

6. **Confirm launch and exit**:
   - Print a summary of what was launched (feature name, model, max iterations, agent CLI)
   - Tell the user to monitor the terminal for progress
   - Exit — do not poll, wait, or watch the script

## Exit Behavior

This command exits as soon as the orchestrator script is launched. It does **not** monitor the script or report its outcome.

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Command completes normally | Orchestrator was launched successfully — user should monitor the terminal |
| Command fails during validation | A prerequisite check failed — see error message for details |

The orchestrator script itself has its own exit codes (0 = all tasks complete, 1 = limit/failure, 130 = interrupted). The user will see these directly in the terminal where the script is running.

## Notes

- This command is a **fire-and-forget launcher** — it validates, configures, launches, and exits
- The orchestrator script handles ALL loop logic: iteration management, termination, progress tracking
- The script runs in a **visible terminal** so the user can watch progress in real time
- This command uses whatever model is active in the current session since it only does lightweight setup work
- Users can also run the scripts directly from terminal for debugging:

  ```bash
  bash .specify/extensions/ralph/scripts/bash/ralph-loop.sh --feature-name "001-feature" --tasks-path "specs/001-feature/tasks.md" --spec-dir "specs/001-feature"
  ```

  ```powershell
  & ".specify/extensions/ralph/scripts/powershell/ralph-loop.ps1" -FeatureName "001-feature" -TasksPath "specs/001-feature/tasks.md" -SpecDir "specs/001-feature"
  ```
