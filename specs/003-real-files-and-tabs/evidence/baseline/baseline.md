## Gates

`clean` — exit 0. `ok-with-findings` — non-zero, but findings were extracted, so the gate ran.
`UNRELIABLE` — non-zero **and** nothing extracted: the gate did not analyse anything, and a
later diff against it would pass whatever is written.

| gate | command | exit | verdict | findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lint | `just lint` | 0 | clean | 0 |
| test | `just test` | 0 | clean | 0 |
| fmt-check | `just fmt-check` | 0 | clean | 0 |
| typecheck | `just typecheck` | 0 | clean | 0 |
| archtest | `just archtest` | 0 | clean | 0 |
| frontend-build | `just frontend-build` | 0 | clean | 0 |

Raw output for every gate is kept in `baseline.logs/`.
